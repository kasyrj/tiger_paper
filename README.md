Analysis code for the article "Crouching TIGER, hidden structure: Exploring the nature of linguistic data using TIGER values". The main part of the code is written in Python3. Assuming the Python interpreter command is "python3", it can be run (after installing the necessary PIP packages from requirements.txt), by:

    python3 master_script.py
    
Notably, the analyses are quite time-consuming due to a large number of tree simulations, and with the current settings will likely take several days to finish.
    
The code has been run within  a linux environment, but should also work in Windows and MacOS.

If you use parts of the code anywhere, please cite the original research paper:
